            <h3>love Astronomy</h3>
            <p>About my childhood, one of the things I remember perfectly is me saying: «I wanna be an astronomer. » It
                has been
                my dream since I remember and now that dream can come true. As a child, the three wizards gave me a
                telescope
                for Christmas and I used to spend lots of hours watching the sky with it. Unfortunately it wasn’t a
                really good
                one, so I only could see little lighting points. But that was enough for me, because the universe has
                always
                fascinated me.</p>
